# TinyPNG Usage Notes

## Current Status

As of July 31, 2025, the TinyPNG image optimization has been temporarily disabled in the `optimizeAndSaveImage` function in `src/SteamPriceCheck.js`. Images are now being saved directly without optimization.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to temporarily disable TinyPNG optimization:

1. Modified the `optimizeAndSaveImage` function in `src/SteamPriceCheck.js` to skip the tinify optimization step
2. Updated the function documentation to indicate the temporary change
3. Updated error messages to reflect that we're now just saving images, not optimizing them
4. Added a comment with the original code for reference

## How to Revert Back to Using TinyPNG

When you want to revert back to using TinyPNG for image optimization, follow these steps:

1. Open `src/SteamPriceCheck.js`
2. Find the `optimizeAndSaveImage` function (around line 50)
3. Replace the current implementation with the following:

```javascript
/**
 * Optimizes an image using TinyPNG API and saves it to disk
 * @param {Buffer} imageBuffer - The image data as a buffer
 * @param {string} imageName - The name to save the image as
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
 */
async function optimizeAndSaveImage(imageBuffer, imageName) {
  try {
    // Optimize image using TinyPNG
    const optimizedImage = await tinify.fromBuffer(imageBuffer).toBuffer();

    // Save optimized image to disk
    await fs.writeFile(path.join(rootDir, 'images', imageName), optimizedImage);

    console.log(`Image saved as ${imageName}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error optimizing and saving image: ${error}`);
    throw new Error(`Image optimization failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

4. Make sure you have a valid TinyPNG API key set in your `.env` file:
   ```
   TINIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Notes

- The tinify library is still imported and the API key is still set, but the actual optimization step is bypassed
- This change only affects new images being saved; existing images remain unchanged
- Image quality may be lower without optimization, but the functionality remains the same
